Core spacing system uses **4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24** for consistent rhythm.
- Tight spacing: `p-4, gap-4` (within cards)
- Standard spacing: `p-6, gap-6` (between sections)
- Loose spacing: `p-8, gap-8` (major layout divisions)
- Section breaks: `py-12, py-16, py-24` (vertical rhythm)

**Grid System**:
- Desktop (lg+): 12-column grid with `gap-6`
- Tablet (md): 8-column grid with `gap-4`
- Mobile (base): Single column with `gap-4`

**Dashboard Layout**:
```
Sidebar (240px fixed) | Main Content (flex-1) | Right Panel (320px, collapsible)
├── Bot Status          ├── Active Dashboard View    ├── Live Activity Feed
├── Navigation         ├── Real-time Charts        ├── Transaction Stream
└── Quick Actions      └── Data Tables             └── Security Alerts
```

**Container Strategy**:
- Full-width: Dashboard backgrounds, live data feeds
- Constrained: `max-w-7xl mx-auto` for content sections
- Cards: `max-w-md` for focused components (wallet cards, bot status)
